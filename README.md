# FavicoFinder

This is a project for an interview at crayon.

I've hosted this on Heroku here:

To start the app:

    node server.js

Requires a MySQL database to connect to, which you can set through the following environment variables:

    export DBHOST=(host);
    export DBPORT=(port);
    export DBSCHEMA=(dbname);
    export DBUSER=(user);
    export DBPASS=(password);
